# There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
# For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
# 1, 1, 1, 1
# 2, 1, 1
# 1, 2, 1
# 1, 1, 2
# 2, 2

n = int(input("How many steps are there ? : "))

def steps(n):
    return n if n <= 3 else (steps(n-1) + steps(n-2))

steps(n)
